For data preparation, we need to handle outliers that may impact our model and one-hot encode features to make sure no data has missing values and also convert categories into numerical representations. We may need to figure out which features contribute significantly to the model's predicting power to simplify the model. We may also need to add regularization to prevent overfitting.
